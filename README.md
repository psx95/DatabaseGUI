# DatabaseGUI
### A JAVAFX powered project to visually compare the performance of 4 most popular SQL and NoSQL databases
The analysis is done on a dataset generated using nobench

### Pre-requisites
* You must have Mysql, Cassandra, Postgres and MongoDB installed on your system
* Services of the above mentioned databases must be running simultaneously.
* If you have passwords set for any of the above the above database services, you will have to edit the Constants.java file, if these services are running on some port other than the default port, it can be changed in Constants.java too.  Support for the GUI to change default password and port numbers will be added later.

### P.S -  The project is still under development and is developed using the Netbeans 8.2 IDE
